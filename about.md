<p>Hi, I'm Isa. I’m about to graduate from 陽明交大 with a master degree in biomedical informatics this year. I have a great passion for data exploring.During these two years, I've done several projects associated with data analytics. These allowed me to gain hands-on experience about how to prepare and process data by different tools, and also help me understand the flow of data analytics</p>

<p>I'm a self-motivated and self-disciplined person. I enjoy in discussing and learning with people from different fields, that will create incredible sparks. Data science is a team work job, Each role has its professional skills and characteristics.Hope one day I can be part of member of Data science team. </p>
